# Hamming-Code-Implementation

## Description

This is simple implementation of Hamming Code with python.

This program can " Encode " , " Error detection and Correction " and " Decode " for message bits.

When you Enter message bits to encode it the program calculate the number of redundant bits and then calculate it's value using the standard Hamming Code Algorithm.

You also can make decode , when you enter a Code Word the program will make error ditection  , if no errors he will decode it else he will ask you to make error detection and correction first .

when you make error detection and correction the program will return you a correct Code Word ,and if error had founded program will return you the postion of error from right .
